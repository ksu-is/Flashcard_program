# Amazing Flashcard Program
Python terminal program containing flashcards for data structures &amp; algorithms.  
This program will allow users to be able to study for their tests effectively.  
This already has a quiz component to it; however, I would like to be able to add a study aspect as well by adding onto the code

update: checked over code and discovered that I did not like it and scrapped the old code.  I then looked online and found other code to use instead
Prelimary tasks

-[X ] check code for any bugs and make sure it runs properly

-[X ] find code online that could be used as a baseline for the study mode

update -[X ] did not like code that was in here and found something better online outside of github

-[ ] find out best way to add study mode 

Actual tasks

-[ ] use online code to help build study mode

-[ ] periodically test code to make sure that the project doesnt break

-[ ] have beginning code for the study mode by end of the week
