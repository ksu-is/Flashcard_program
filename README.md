# KnowItAll Flashcards
Python terminal program containing flashcards for data structures &amp; algorithms.  
This program will allow users to be able to study for their tests effectively.  
This already has a quiz component to it; however, I would like to be able to add a study aspect as well by adding onto the code


update: checked over code and discovered that I did not like it and scrapped the old code.  I then looked online and found other code to use instead. Updated code used from this website: https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/code/467095/creating-a-flashcard-like-quiz-game-python
